This project was made using Python 3.10.14, to install the requirements to run all codes use: pip install -r requirements.txt

If you face problems with the installation of gym[box2d] install swig on anaconda (if you are not using anaconda, the answer is still unknown to us)

To train your own network in each of the methods implemented simply run the python file with name train... (such as: 'python train_model.py' for the Deep-Q-Learning method)

After training you can realocate the saved weights of the neural network to the file saves ans run the file test.py (before running make sure to select your desidered model in the test.py code and change correctely the name of the expected files with the weights to each method, additionaly some weights are already given)
